/*
Package raft is an implementation of the raft consensus protocol.

This library provides a simple, easy-to-understand, and reliable implementation of Raft using Go. Raft is a consensus
protocol designed to manage replicated logs in a distributed system. Its purpose is to ensure fault-tolerant coordination
and consistency among a group of nodes, making it suitable for building reliable systems. Potential use cases include
distributed file systems, consistent key-value stores, and service discovery.
