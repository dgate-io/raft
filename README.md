# raft
This library provides a simple, easy-to-understand, and reliable implementation of [Raft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(algorithm)) using Go. Raft is a [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)) protocol designed to manage replicated logs in a distributed system. Its purpose is to ensure fault-tolerant coordination and consistency among a group of nodes, making it suitable for building reliable systems. Potential use case include distributed file systems, consistent key-value stores, and service discovery.
